# **Weeks 6 & 7: Java Backend - Spring Boot**

Welcome to the repository for Weeks 6 and 7 of our Java learning journey. These two weeks marked the transition from core Java programming to backend development using the Spring Boot framework. We explored the foundations of web applications, RESTful API development, multi-layered architecture, and built a small backend application.

## **Overview**

These weeks introduced us to enterprise-level Java development with Spring Boot. We began by understanding how Java servlets work with Tomcat, moved into setting up Spring Boot applications, and developed REST APIs. We also implemented a multi-layered application structure with persistence using an H2 in-memory database, culminating in a hands-on payroll application project.

## **Topics Covered**

### **Day 1: Tomcat Servlet**

* Introduction to web servers and Tomcat  
* Understanding servlets and servlet lifecycle  
* Writing a basic servlet in Java  
* Handling HTTP requests and responses  
* Deploying servlets in Tomcat  

### **Day 2: Spring Intro**

* Introduction to the Spring Framework  
* Setting up a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr  
* Overview of Spring Boot annotations and structure  
* Dependency injection and inversion of control (IoC)  
* Running a simple Spring Boot application  

### **Day 3: Spring REST API Calls and Request Handling**

* Understanding REST architecture  
* Creating RESTful endpoints using Spring Boot  
* `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`  
* Handling HTTP requests and responses  
* JSON serialization and deserialization  

### **Day 4: Spring Framework and Multi-Layer Development with H2 DB**

* Layered architecture in Spring (Controller, Service, Repository)  
* Introduction to H2 in-memory database  
* Connecting Spring Boot with H2 using Spring Data JPA  
* Creating entity classes and repositories  
* Using `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Entity` annotations  

### **Day 5: Spring Employee Payroll App Setup with Service Layer**

* Designing a simple payroll system backend  
* Setting up service layer for business logic  
* Defining REST endpoints for employee CRUD operations  
* Testing service layer logic  
* Integration with H2 for data persistence  

## **Prerequisites**

* Completion of Week 5: IO Programming  
* Understanding of Java OOP concepts and file handling  
* Basic knowledge of HTTP, JSON, and RESTful APIs  
* Java Development Kit (JDK) and Maven installed  
* IntelliJ IDEA or similar IDE with Spring Boot support  

## **How to Use This Repository**

This repository is structured to reflect the topics covered each day. You can find code examples, notes, or exercises within the respective daily folders (if available). Feel free to explore the code, run it, and modify it to deepen your understanding.

## **Next Steps**

In the upcoming weeks, we will dive deeper into Spring Boot development including validation, security, deployment, and building complete RESTful applications. Stay consistent and keep building!
